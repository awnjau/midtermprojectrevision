      <p> Hi! Welcome to the wonderful world of Greek philosophy. This website is all about love.<br> What are the types of love according to the ancient Greek?<br>
      Where do we see those ideas in our modern world? <br>How can we connect them to the ways in which we love today?</p>

        <p><i>Sexual Desire</i><br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="div-7b">
      <p>Eros, named after the Greek god of fertility, is about sexual passion. The Greek gods saw this form of love as fiery, dangerous and irrational. It involves an all-consuming lust and a lack of control
        that frightened the Greek. <br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-7c">
        <p> Yet today, we see a more interesting approach to Eros. People fiend for a type of love that reliquishes control, something passionate and intense.A lot of us hope to fall madly in love, but is that real?
           Is it sustainable? Longlasting? Mostly, these are romantic relationships that are shorterm, especially if you're young. Is that such a bad thing, however? Isn't it nice to think that you can have genuine passion and heat in a relationship
           at least once in your life, even if it doesn't last forever?<br><br></p>

          <p><i>Long-Standing Love</i><br></p>
          </div>
          <div class="div-8b">
          <p>Pragma is best described as a mature and realistic love. This one is a bit of a modern update of ancient Greek terms, since it was popularized in the 1970s and never explicitely used by ancient Greeks. It's meant to summarize
            Greek standards of love that stands the test of time. A wholesome love that takes compromise, patience and tolerance.<br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-8c">
            <p>If eros is about falling madly in love, then pragma is about standing in love. In this day and age, I think, mostly for young people, we want to be consumed by romantic love, but fail to understand that it's
              something that takes effort. Maintaing relationships isn't something that many of us think about, which is okay. You don't need to have long-lasting love if you don't want to. But if you do, you need to be prepared to handle the issues
              that come with it with maturity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

        <p><i>Love of Self</i><br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-10b">
        <p>Philautia can best be described as a love of oneself. This can be catagorized in two main ways. The first is a love of self that's so all-consuming it becomes unhealthy narcissism. A more positive perspective on philautia is a love of self
          that enhances your capacity to love others. It's about being secure in yourself to the point that you're able to give plenty of love to others. <br></p>
          </div>
          <div class="div-10c">
          <p> Self acceptance is an ever changing journey that almost every person on Earth has to go through. I think more people have issues with the second category of philautia, especially with the rise of social media and the constant change in beauty standards.
            It can fester and get worse, especially if you're so far from the standard. Such has having a physical disability, living in a fat body and, largely for women, being over the age of like 35. We live in a world where it's so hard to love yourself because of the
            massive amounts of content surrounding other people's lives and bodies thrown at us.<br><br></p>

            <div class="div-11b">
            <p>Agape is charactarized as a love that extends to all people. It's a type of universal love and was initially radicial because it was meant to extend to anyone, regardless of whether or not they're your family or friend. It was later translated into Latin as 'caritas'
              ,which is where the word 'charity' now comes from.<br></p>
              </div>
              <div class="div-11c">
              <p>Agape is what you do once you've gotten a hold of philautia. After being able to find love inwards, you express love outwardly. This kind of love provides you with the empathy that's required to put yourself into other people's shoes. I think that there's a disturbing lack
                of empathy that many people lack, especially in the West. We talk about loving thy neighbor, but how much are you actually willing to do for a stranger in need. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

          </div>
          <div class="div-13b">
          <p>Ludus is a sort of playful love. One that holds no true commitment or longevity. Greek scholars took inspiration from Roman poet Ovid to use this term to describe love between children or casual lovers. Typically in the early stages of relationships, ludus explains the
            flirting and teasing that comes with these less intense relationships. <br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-13c">
            <p> This might be my favorite love type. Ludus, is perhaps, a form of love we experience most often, especially if you're a college aged person. It's void of seriousness and most prevelent in party atmospheres during dancing and bantering. It's often depicted as something crude or desperate, especially as people get older,
              but I think it's just harmless fun. Which is something that everyone needs sometimes. I think we should expand our modern ideas of love to include something casual, easy and fun, like ludus, for all consenting peoples.<br><br></p>

              </div>
              <div class="div-14b">
              <p>Philia concerns the deep comradery of friendship. This, historically, was valued far more than the sexuality if something like eros. It was originally used to describe the kind of bond formed by men who fought side by side on the battle field. This love is about showing loyalty to your friends by sacrificing for them
                and sharing your emotions with one another.<br></p>
                </div>
                <div class="div-14c">
                <p>What is our current definition of friendship? Is is the number of likes we get on a post? Is it how many people swipe right on our Bumble BFF profile? I do think we've gotten a little too comfortable with calling anyone our friend. I mean, how much do we really know about the people we call our best companions? There's
                  absolutely nothing wrong with having casual friendships, after all, that's how deeper friendships start out, but it's important to understand just what it means to truly call someone your friend. We all need someone who chooses to do right by you and who you find yourself choosing to do right by.<br><br><br></p>
